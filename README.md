# ADS_Assignment2
In this assignment I created 2 classes: MyArrayList and MyLinkedList that implement one interface - MyList, without usage of java.util.ArrayList and java.util.LinkedList.
In each class I overrided methods: size(), contains(), add(), remove(), clear(), get(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf().
In the Main class I tested all the methods of classes with captions and comments.
